        <h1>The Walking Dead Season 10</h1>
        <p>While the cast and crew of AMC‘s The Walking Dead enjoy the response they’ve been getting for the tenth
            season, life in the franchise’s universe has become a lot like the NFL: neither have off-seasons anymore.
            With a strong ensemble cast (and a “Big Bad” fronted by Samantha Morton in an award-earning turn as
            Whisperers leader Alpha) and richly layered writing, showrunner/executive producer Angela Kang did the
            near-impossible: made the show feel fresh and dangerous again. With the series set to return to AMC on
            Sunday, February 23, viewers have already gotten a look at what lies ahead – including Michonne’s (Danai
            Gurira) return, a shirtless Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Eugene (Josh McDermitt)/Rosita (Christian
            Serratos) kiss, and Morton’s bloody Alpha</p>

        <h1>John Wick 1</h1>
        <p>Considering its origins as a pretty straightforward revenge story, the John Wick action movie franchise could
            easily have continued churning out boilerplate sequels. Instead, it has swiftly created a fictional world
            steeped in arcane lore which becomes more complex with each new chapter. The films take place within an
            unseen demimonde, populated by assassins who adhere to all kinds of ancient traditions, and abide by a
            certain code. In that way, the Keanu Reeves-fronted series isn't that far removed from the Star Wars movies,
            which boast a similarly mysterious order of warriors in the form of Jedi Knights. So, in a move which
            absolutely nobody asked for but yielded some pretty amazing results, special effects YouTube channel
            ImmersionVFX put a lightsaber in Keanu Reeves' hand. Using footage from the most recent installment, John
            Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum, editors digitally inserted lightsabers into a series of sword fights from the
            movie, turning what was already a hi-octane thrill ride into a neon-infused glimpse at just how well-suited
            the preternaturally chill Keanu would be to playing a Jedi if the inclination ever arose.</p>

        <h1>The Flash</h1>
        <p>The latest development in Barry and Patty’s relationship on The Flash was poorly executed. But it’s more than
            that. It’s no secret that The Flash is male-dominated. When we look at the main cast from season 1, we had
            Barry Allen, Joe West, Iris West, Eddie Thawne, Cisco Ramon, Caitlin Snow and Harrison Wells. That’s more
            than twice as many male characters (five) as female (two). When we add in Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond,
            the disparity becomes even greater. Even if we want to add Linda Park into that secondary category, we still
            have a huge gap between the two.</p>
